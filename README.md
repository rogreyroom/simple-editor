# Simple editor â‡’ notebook

It supposed to be a simple editor but let's make a notebook - or so

## Project assumptions

- one textarea to take a note
- save the note after textarea out of focus
- save in localStorage as a flat array of objects
- when a note is saved, the note list will be created as a slideshow on the website
- the note list is made after the website is loaded - if the notes exist in the localStorage
- maybe add edit and delete notes option
